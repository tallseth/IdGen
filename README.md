## Explanation

This project began as a fork from the excellent [IdGen](https://raw.github.com/RobThree/IdGen) project written by [Rob Janssen](https://github.com/RobThree).  He continues to maintain the original and publishes a [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdGen) for immediate use.

I originally thought that I would take a fork and maybe make small tweaks to contribute back.  I played around with how I might change it to be targeted more to my specific needs, and without the burden of compatibility with the needs of his user base.  I was conflicted for a bit on the decision of whether to make my own idiomatic mark on this code, or to align myself with what existed.  In the end, I decided to interpret the choice of MIT License as the author's intent for the code to be modified to suit, and moved in that direction.  This resulted in changes that range from tiny and stylistic to moderate design changes and feature cuts.  None of these changes is a critique of the original, but simply unfettered play to meet my needs and personal preferences.

I am very grateful for this excellent starting point and the spirit of goodwill that allows permissions for this type of exploration and personalization.

I may yet contribute back some of the ideas that incubate in this personal playground, but that will be from another fork of the original repo.  I will not provide this code as an alternate nuget package or anything similar.
